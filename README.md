## Dad Jokes

As the page loads, application via an API fetches 10 new jokes which includes
'vote up' and 'vote down' buttons as well as the cumulative net score for each joke.
Users are then able to update these scores, which results in jokes to move up or down (sort)
accordingly while also the emoji changing according to the score.
All data is saved via local storage, application includes some very cool animations as well!
